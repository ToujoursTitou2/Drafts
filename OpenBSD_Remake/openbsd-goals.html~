    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <span class="text">
      <section>
	<p>Obviously, each developer working on OpenBSD has their own aims and priorities, but it is possible to classify the goals we all share :<br></p>
	<p><br><a href="#">Provide the best development platform possible. Provide full source access to developers and users, including the ability to look at CVS tree changes directly.</a><br> Users can even look at our source tree and changes <a href="#">directly on the web!</a></p>
	<p>Integrate good code from any source with <a href="#">acceptable licenses.</a> ISC or Berkeley style licenses are preferred, the GPL is not acceptable when adding new code, NDAs are never acceptable.<br> We want to make available source code that anyone can use for ANY PURPOSE, with no restrictions. <a href="#">We strive to make our software robust and secure, and encourage compagnies<br> to use whichever pieces they want to.</a> There are commercial spin-offs of OpenBSD.<br></p>
	<p>Pay attention to <a href="#">security problems and fix them before anyone else does.</a> (Try to be the #1 list secure operating system.)<br></p>
	<p><a href="#">Greater integration of cryptographic software.</a> OpenBSD is developed and released from Canada and due to Canadian alw it is legal to export crypto to the world(as <a href="#">researched by a <br>Canadian individual and as documented in the Export Control list of Canada).</a><br></p>
	<p>Track and implement standards (ANSI, POSIX, parts of X/Open, etc.)<br></p>
	<p>Work towards a very machine independent source tree. <a href="#">Support as amny different systems and hardware as feasible.</a><br></p>
	<p>Be as politics-free as possible; solutions should be decided on the basis of technical merit.<br></p>
	<p>Focus on being developer-oriented in all senses, including holding developer-only events called <a href="#">hackathons.</a><br></p>
	<p>Do not let serious problems unsolved.<br></p>
	<p>Make a release approximately every six months.<br></p>
